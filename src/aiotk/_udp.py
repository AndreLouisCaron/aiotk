    """Simple UDP-based service.

    The only examples for UDP in asyncio documentation use protocols, the
    callback-based APIs and are a bit confusing (connection made?  connection
    lost?).

    This helper method tries to turn the low-level UDP socket support into a
    stream-based API.  You pass in a coroutine function to which a pair of
    queues will be passed.  From there, you can use async/await syntax to send
    and receive packets.

    :param host: Network interface on which to bind.
    :param port: Port number on which to bind.
    :service: coroutine that will perform logic.
    :param loop: Loop in which the service will run.

    The ``service`` coroutine should have the following signature:

    .. code-block:: python

       async def my_udp_service(*, iqueue, oqueue, loop, **kwds):
           pass

    The ``iqueue`` and ``oqueue`` parameters are ``asyncio.Queue`` objects that
    the coroutine can use to read from and write to, respectively.

    .. versionadded:: 0.4

    .. versionchanged:: 0.5 Added the ability to bind on a dynamically chosen
       port.
